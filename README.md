# Azure Vector Databases

## üß≠ Goal
This project provides hands-on experience with multiple **Vector Database** options available in **Azure**. It is designed to help you explore and compare capabilities such as similarity search, vector indexing, and retrieval across popular Azure-managed services.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è High-Level Flow

- Provision and configure vector-enabled databases on Azure
- Load vector data (e.g., embeddings from OpenAI or other models)
- Perform vector search (KNN or ANN)
- Compare performance, capabilities, and limitations across services

Supported vector DB options:
- **Azure SQL Database**
- **Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL (vCore)**
- **Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB (vCore)**

---

## üéØ Who This Is For

This repository is useful for:
- Developers evaluating vector search options on Azure
- Data engineers building semantic search pipelines
- AI/ML practitioners integrating embeddings into apps
- Architects comparing Azure-native vector stores for GenAI use cases
